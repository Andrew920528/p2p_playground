# Project Description

This project uses `libp2p`, a modern, modular library to create p2p overlay system. In `peer.js`, I defined a Peer class, which is a node in the p2p system. I wrote multiple test cases in run.js to show the statistics relevant to a 6-node p2p toy environment.

This project is for HW2, Option1, and contains workload setup for both 1.2.1 and 1.2.2

# Setup

To run this project, you will need to have npm installed. In the root directory, run

```
npm install
```

After that, run

```
node run.js
```

to start the p2p system.

# Deliverables

1. `README.md` and executable code in zip file. You can find the github repo here: (https://github.com/Andrew920528/p2p_playground)
2. Screenshots: Please find them in the `screenshots` folder. `note.md` describes what each screenshot demonstrates.
3. Measurement, results, discussion, and reflection: Please find it in a separate hw submission. I also attached a copy of it in the zip file called `results_and_reflection`.
